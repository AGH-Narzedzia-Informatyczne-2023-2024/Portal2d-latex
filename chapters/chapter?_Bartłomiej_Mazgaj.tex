\textbf{Zdzisław Beksiński} was a Polish painter, photographer, and sculptor; specializing in the field of dystopian surrealism.\par
\textbf{Beksiński} made his paintings and drawings in what he called either a Baroque or a Gothic manner. His creations were made mainly in two periods. The first period of work is generally considered to contain expressionistic color, with a strong style of "utopian realism" and surreal architecture, like a doomsday scenario. The second period contained more abstract style, with the main features of formalism.\par
\textbf{Beksiński} was stabbed to death at his Warsaw apartment on February 21, 2005, by a 19-year-old acquaintance from Wołomin, reportedly because he refused to lend him money.
